// This bit is set if the timer hardware is duplicated across each processor.
// That is, the actual timer hardware being interacted with depends on which

// to have the same attributes on all processors.
//

#define TIMER_PER_PROCESSOR 0x00000001

//
// This bit is set if the timer's counter is readable by the HAL. If this bit
// is set, then the QueryCounter function is mandatory. It is expected that
// once initialized, the counter will operate in increasing free-running mode
// from 0 to its maximum bit width. When it reaches its maximum bit width, it
// will roll over to 0 and continue counting. Actions performed on other timers
// should not affect this timer's counter. If arming or querying other
// registered timers affects this timer's counter, it should not have this
// bit set.
//

#define TIMER_COUNTER_READABLE 0x00000002

//
// Set if the counter can be written to. It's fine if the counter has to be
// stopped to write to it.
//

#define TIMER_COUNTER_WRITABLE 0x00000004

//
// Set if the timer has a configurable input clock divisor. If this bit is set,
// the SetDivisor function is mandatory.
//

#define TIMER_HAS_DIVISOR 0x00000008

//
// This bit is set if the timer is capable of generating a periodic interval by
// continually rearming the timer in one-shot mode. If the timer supports this
// mode, it must not introduce additional delay by the re-armings. Only
// deadline-based timers or timers that run off a match register are known to
// support this mode, as other forms of timers introduce delay in the process
// of re-setting the timer.
//

#define TIMER_PSEUDO_PERIODIC_CAPABLE 0x00000010

//
// This bit is set if the timer is capable of generating one-shot interrupts.
// A one-shot interrupt is an interrupt that will fire once after the specified
// number of ticks, but does not automatically rearm itself to fire
// periodically at that rate.
//

#define TIMER_ONE_SHOT_CAPABLE 0x00000020

//
// This bit is set if the timer is capable of generating periodic interrupts.
// A periodic interrupt is an interrupt that will come in at a regular
// interval after a certain number of ticks. The only difference between
// periodic and pseudo-periodic mode is the implied amount of work the timer
// has to do in the acknowledge interrupt routine. It is assumed that
// re-arming the timer for a new one-shot tick is more expensive in terms of
// hardware access than setting the timer in periodic mode. The HAL will also
// not attempt lossless rate changes on a timer armed in pseudo-periodic mode.
//

#define TIMER_PERIODIC_CAPABLE 0x00000040

//
// This bit is set if the timer cannot generate interrupts at an arbitrary tick
// count, but is only capable of generating interrupts when the timer rolls
// over from its maximum value to 0. The ACPI PM timer is an example of such a
// timer.
//

#define TIMER_ROLLOVER_INTERRUPTS_ONLY 0x00000080

//
// This bit is set if the timer is connected to one of the dual 8259 interrupt
// controllers on a PC/AT system. This bit should never be set on ARM.
//

#define TIMER_GENERATES_8259_INTERRUPTS 0x00000100

//
// This bit is set if the timer generates interrupts connected to a line of the
// interrupt controller. This line may be a normal device line or processor
// local line. If this bit is set, the GSI field is used to determine which
// line the timer's interrupt is connected to.
//

#define TIMER_GENERATES_LINE_BASED_INTERRUPTS 0x00000200

//
// This bit is set if the timer can generate MSI interrupts. If this bit is
// set, the SetMessageInterruptRouting function is mandatory.
//

#define TIMER_GENERATES_MSI_INTERRUPTS 0x00000400

//
// This bit is set if the timer's interrupt is generated internally by the
// interrupt controller. These timers have no interrupt line and generally
// vector to the set location automatically. Timers that generate internal
// interrupts are generally built directly into the interrupt controller. The
// Local APIC timer on the PC is an example of such a timer. At this time, no
// known ARM timers fit this category.

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine is responsible for initializing the timer hardware. This is
    guaranteed to be the first timer routine called by the HAL. It must prepare
    the timer for use by beginning the timer's counter ticking if the counter
    is readable, setting the intial input clock divisor to 1 if applicable,
    and masking all interrupts. If the timer's stop routine is called, this
    routine will be called before the timer is queried or armed again. It will
    not be called between every rearming of the timer.

    This routine will not be called concurrently with any other calls to
    this HAL Timer extension. For per-processor timers, this routine will be
    called once on each processor. A failure on any processor blocks the timer's
    use on all processors.

Arguments:

    TimerData - Supplies a pointer to the timer's private context. The contents
        of this pointer were specified when the timer was initially registered,
        and may be modified inside this routine. The HAL does not interpret any
        data deferenced from this pointer.

Return Value:

    Returns an NT status code indicating success or failure. If a successful
    status code is returned then the HAL may subsequently call further routines
    in this HAL extension to query or arm the timer. If a failure code is
    returned, this HAL extension will not attempt to use this timer unless the
    Initialize routine is called again and succeeds.

Routine Description:

    Timers are assumed to always count *up*. If the actual timer hardware counts
    down, then this routine should subtract the current count from the maximum
    counter value so that values appear to count up. This routine may be called
    concurrently on multiple processors and must be reentrant. This routine is
    extremely performance sensitive, as it may be used to back the system
    performance counter.

    concurrently on multiple processors. This routine will be called on every
    timer interrupt at the hardware priority level of that interrupt, so this
    routine is extremely performance sensitive. For timers running in
    pseudo-periodic mode, this routine must rearm the timer for the same
    interval as it was armed with without introducing delay into the interrupt
    interval. Only deadline-based timers support pseudo-periodic mode.

Routine Description:

    This routine set's the counter's input frequency divisor, controlling the

    divisor to 1, so if this is the appropriate value then this routine will
    not get called during initialization. This routine will not get called
    concurrently with other timer routines, but may be called after the timer
    has already been armed to fire an interrupt. On per-processor timers,
    this routine may get called concurrently on different processors. The
    counter is expected to be ticking at the new divisor rate by the time this
    routine returns.

Arguments:

    TimerData - Supplies a pointer to the timer's private context, whose
        initial content was supplied when the timer was registered.

    NewDivisor - Supplies the new divisor rate to set. This value will be a
        power of two and will be less than or equal to the timer's specified

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine arms a timer to fire an interrupt after the given number of
    timer ticks. For timers that only interrupt on rollovers, this simply
    enables the interrupt, the tick count parameter is ignored. If the timer
    is currently armed for a different mode or tick count, this call is
    expected to replace that programming. This routine will not get called
    concurrently with other timer calls, except on per-processor timers, where
    it may get called concurrently on different processors.

Arguments:

    TimerData - Supplies a pointer to the timer's private context, whose
        initial content was supplied when the timer was registered.

    Mode - Supplies the mode to arm the timer in, which will be one of the
        modes the HAL extension advertised support for when registering the
        timer. The modes are as follows:

        OneShot - Arms the timer to fire the given number of ticks from now.
            Only one interrupt is expected to come in. The HAL does not make
            assumptions on whether or not the expiration of this interrupt
            causes the counter to stop. The Query Counter routine will not be
            called while a timer is armed to fire an interrupt.

        Periodic - Arms the timer to fire periodically with an interval of the
            given number of ticks. The first interrupt should happen
            approximately the given number of ticks from when the arm timer
            function was invoked.

        PseudoPeriodic - Arms the timer with the same functional behavior as
            periodic mode, with the knowledge that the timer will have to rearm
            itself during the acknowledge interrupt routine. This mode is
            expected to have slightly worse performance than pure periodic mode,
            but is expected to generate periodic interrupts at the exact rate
            specified.

    TickCount - Supplies the number of ticks from now that the timer should
        assert its interrupt in. For timers that are only capable of
        interrupting on rollovers from their maximum value to 0, this parameter
        is ignored.

Return Value:

    Returns and NTSTATUS code indicating success or failure. If the timer
    returns success, then the interrupt is expected to come in the specified
    number of ticks from when the function was called, with a tolerance of
    however long the function took to execute. If the routine fails, then no
    timer routines will be called again until the timer Initialize routine is
    called again and succeeds. In most cases, returning a failure code results
    in a system bugcheck.

Routine Description:

    This routine enables or disables message signalled interrupts on the given
    timer and configures the address and data of the message to generate on
    interrupts. This function only needs to be implemented on timers that have
    indicated they are capable of generating message signalled interrupts.

Arguments:

    TimerData - Supplies a pointer to the timer's private context, whose
        initial content was supplied when the timer was registered.

    Enable - Supplies a flag indicating whether or not MSI delivery mode should
        be enabled (TRUE) or disabled (FALSE). For timers that can generate
        both line based and MSI-based interrupts, this parameter determines
        which type should be used.

    MessageAddress - Supplies the physical address to send the message to.
        This parameter should be ignored when MSIs are being disabled.

    MessageData - Supplies the value to write to the specified address. This
        parameter should be ignored when MSIs are being disabled.

Routine Description:

    This routine changes the rate of a timer that is already operating in

    capability.

        initial content was supplied when the timer was registered.

    NewTickCount - Supplies the new periodic rate, in hardware counter
        ticks.

Return Value:

    Returns the number of interrupts that will occur at the old rate.

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine accurately stalls execution for timers that cannot directly
    expose the timer's counter. This routine is used when the timer is capable
    of being an accurate stall source but its counter is unreadable or its
    stall durations cannot be arbitrary lengths of time. An example of this is
    the CMOS RTC on the PC, which can generate accurate stalls of 1Hz by
    polling the "Update In Progress" bit. This routine will always be called
    twice in immediate succession: once to allow the timer to potentially
    adjust to its fixed-stall cadence, and then once to actually perform the
    stall. The return value from the first call is always ignored. This routine
    is only used once during boot to measure the frequency of the processor if
    no other timers with known frequencies are available. All interrupts are
    disabled at this time. It is not used during normal stall execution calls,
    for that a readable counter is used.

Arguments:

    TimerData - Supplies a pointer to the timer's private context, whose
        initial content was supplied when the timer was registered.

    MinimumStallIn100ns - Supplies the minimum amount of time to stall for in
        100 nanosecond units (10^-7 seconds), or 0 to indicate this is the
        "warm-up" call to allow the timer to adjust to its potentially fixed
        stall cadence. When this parameter is 0, the return value of this
        routine is ignored.

Return Value:

    This routine should return 0 if 0 is passed into the minimum stall
    duration.

} TIMER_INITIALIZATION_BLOCK, *PTIMER_INITIALIZATION_BLOCK;

/*++

Timer Initialization Block Description:

    Stores the information required of the timer module by the HAL for the HAL
    to register a new timer source.

Fields:

    Header - Stores the structure size and version number. Do not fill in these
        members directly. Use the INITIALIZE_TIMER_HEADER macro to ensure these
        values are set correctly. Pass a pointer to the
        TIMER_INITIALIZATION_BLOCK as the only argument to the macro. The HAL
        will fail the registration call if it does not recognize this header.

    FunctionTable - Stores pointers to all implemented timer functions. The HAL
        will call these functions to interact with the timer extension during
        the initialization, use, and shutdown phases. Not all functions are
        mandatory, the mandatory functions are governed by which capabilities
        are set.

    InternalData - Stores a pointer to the initial value of the timer's
        internal data. This pointer is not referenced after the call to
        register the timer returns, as it is assumed to be a pointer to a local
        variable. A copy of this data is made and passed to the extension on
        each function call.

    InternalDataSize - Stores the number of bytes in the internal data
        structure. The contents of the Internal Data are never read or
        interpreted by the HAL. This allocation size is expected to be only a
        few bytes, allocating too much space may cause the system not to boot
        due to the limited ability to allocate memory before the memory manager
        is online.

    CounterBitWidth - Stores the number of bits in the timer's internal counter.
        Even if the timer's counter is not directly accessible to the HAL or
        the extension, this parameter must be filled in, as it is used in
        calculations for arming the timer and configuring its divisor.

    CounterFrequency - Stores the frequency of the counter, in Hertz. Even if
        the timer's counter is not directly accessible to the HAL or the
        extension, this parameter must be filled in, as it is used in
        calculations for arming the timer and configuring its divisor. If the
        timer is variant, this must be set to its fastest speed. This parameter
        may be set to 0 to indicate that the HAL extension does not have
        enough information to determine the counter's frequency. The HAL will
        then use another registered timer whose frequency parameter is filled
        in or the processor cycle counter itself to measure the frequency of
        this timer. This measured frequency is never reported back to the HAL
        extension, as the HAL arms the timer in terms of "ticks", not seconds.

    MaxDivisor - Stores the highest counter divisor supported by the hardware.
        Some timers implement a divisor on the input clock that drives the
        counter. Setting the divisor to 2 for instance causes the counter to
        count at half its normal frequency. If the timer can be configured at
        runtime for an arbitrary power of 2 divisor between 1 and N, then the
        MaxDivisor field can be set to N. The HAL may attempt to change the
        divisor after the timer has been initialized to any power of 2 between
        1 and MaxDivisor. If the timer does not implement a power of 2 divisor,
        set this field to 1. The HAL assumes that the initial divisor
        configured in the timer at initialization is 1.

    Capabilities - Stores the capabilities of the current timer, such as the
        ability to generate interrupts, the ability to have its counter read or
        written, etc.

    Interrupt - Stores information about the interrupt this timer generates,
        if applicable.

    KnownType - Stores an identifier that marks this as a known timer type to
        the HAL. The HAL may choose to make certain decisions differently if it
        is familiar with this type of timer.

    Identifier - Stores a 32-bit integer used to uniquely identify this timer.
        Set this to the same value as the UID for the Resource Descriptor.

Routine Description:

    This routine permanently stakes out a piece of physical memory for use by
    the SoC module. This routine does not map that memory anywhere, it just
    claims it. This registration cannot be undone.

Arguments:

    PhysicalAddress - Supplies the physical address to register.

    SizeInBytes - Supplies the size of the physical allocation, in byte.

Return Value:

    STATUS_SUCCESS on success.

    STATUS_NO_MEMORY if the allocation could not be reserved.

    STATUS_TOO_LATE if the call is made after the HAL initialization phase is
    complete.
